The "switch" statement

A switch statement can replace multiple if checks.
It gives a more descriptive way to compare a value with multiple variants.

The syntax

The switch has one or more case blocks and an optional default.
It looks like this:
switch(x) {
  case 'value1':  // if (x === 'value1')
    ...
    [break]

  case 'value2':  // if (x === 'value2')
    ...
    [break]

  default:
    ...
    [break]
}
The value of x is checked for a strict equality to the value from the first case (that is, value1) then to the second (value2) and so on.
If the equality is found, switch starts to execute the code starting from the corresponding case, until the nearest break (or until the end of switch).
If no case is matched then the default code is executed (if it exists).

An example
An example of switch (the executed code is highlighted):

let a = 2 + 2;

switch (a) {
  case 3:
    alert( 'Too small' );
    break;
  case 4:
    alert( 'Exactly!' );
    break;
  case 5:
    alert( 'Too big' );
    break;
  default:
    alert( "I don't know such values" );
}
